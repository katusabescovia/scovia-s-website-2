                Uganda,[b] officially the Republic of Uganda,[c] is a landlocked country in East Africa. The country is
                bordered to the east by Kenya, to the north by South Sudan, to the west by the Democratic Republic of
                the Congo, to the south-west by Rwanda, and to the south by Tanzania. The southern part of the country
                includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, shared with Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda is in the
                African Great Lakes region, lies within the Nile basin, and has a varied but generally modified
                equatorial climate. As of 2023, it has a population of around 49.6 million, of which 8.5 million live in
                the capital and largest city of Kampala.
